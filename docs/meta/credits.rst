About
-----

`JsFiddle <http://jsfiddle.net>`_ is a playground for front-end web developers
created and maintained by `Piotr <http://webdev.zalewa.info/>`_ and `Oskar
<http://nouincolor.com/>`_.

jsFiddle provides an online editor for snippets built from HTML, CSS and
JavaScript which are called Fiddles. Fiddles can then be shared with others,
embedded into blog posts, linked from StackOverflow questions, forum posts,
etc. Using this approach, jsFiddle can help JavaScript and CSS developers
isolate and get fixes for bugs and share code and best practices.

We aim to support all actively developed JS frameworks.

You can read more about the platform in `David Walsh's interview with Piotr
<http://davidwalsh.name/jsfiddle-interview>`_.
