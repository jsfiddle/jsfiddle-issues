Contributing
============

Currently our core source code is private, however there are additional
ways that you can help us to improve.


Platform
--------

We use GitHub to track bugs and suggestions for the platform.

**Bugs**
  If you think you have found one then please:

  * Create a Fiddle that shows the error occurring, if possible.
  * Share your example / problem with others, this will help us to
    evaluate the scope of the issue.
  * Check against the list of `open issues
    <https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-docs-alpha/issues>`_ to ensure
    that this has not been reported already.
  * As a result, if you feel your bug is valid, please create a `new
    issue <https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-docs-alpha/issues/new>`_
    on GitHub.

**Suggestions**
  We welcome your suggestions for the platform - however, please be aware
  that we have a firm roadmap for its continued development. The best way
  to share your suggestion is to create create a `new
  issue <https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-docs-alpha/issues/new>`_
  on GitHub.


.. note::
   We use the *jsFiddle-docs-alpha* issue system for the live site and all
   jsFiddle related problems.


Documentation
-------------

This documentation is a work in progress. Please feel free to contribute.

* Please fork the `jsFiddle-docs-alpha repository 
  <http://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-docs-alpha>`_, make your
  contributions and `create a pull request
  <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_.
* Alternatively, you can just open an `issue 
  <http://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-docs-alpha/issues>`_ and we'll take
  a look at it.


Sharing
-------

More "gentle" contributions are also great. Please share your Fiddles, talk
to us on one of the :doc:`many channels <channels>` and use the
:ref:`jsFiddle logo <logos>` when writing about the
platform.
