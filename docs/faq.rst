Code is working on jsFiddle, not on site/local machine
######################################################

Please compare the source on your page with the :ref:`result_draft`. Check 
if your script loads all the specified libraries (check for 404 errors using 
the web console in your browser). We do host some of the libraries, please
upload them to your site before using.

How can I name a fiddle?
########################

One can add the title to the fiddle in the :ref:`fiddle_settings-info`, but 
the hashtag in URL is always generated automatically.


What about a node/PHP/Python/ASP fiddle?
########################################

Our current goal is to help with front-end development. For back-end please 
use `Ideone <http://ideone.com/>`_ or `JSApps <http://jsapp.us/>`_.

Why jsFiddle is not working in IE6 (or other old browser)?
##########################################################

Editor is not designed to be working on old browsers. For testing purposes 
we've created the :ref:`result_draft` feature. It will also help with testing on 
mobile devices.
